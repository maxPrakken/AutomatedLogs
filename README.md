# AutomatedLogs
this is a C based terminal application that makes logging what you do and did in a day extreemly easy

Here are the commands and what they do:
-start : takes one argument, the name of the activity you want to name it. call this to start your day or add a new activity in a already ongoing day.
-add : takes three arguments, the name of the activity you want to name it, the start time, and the end time, use this if you want to add something in the day that you forgot to start.
-stop : stops the day, does a final save on your day and rounds it up.
-folder : sets the folder where you want your .txt's and .pdf's to save.
